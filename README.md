# WebGLBrush
WebGLBrush is my final project for my bachelor's graduation. It's a pure front-end project based on SculptGL. Inspired by ZBrush, a commercial software which does 3D modeling jobs with the digital sculpting solution, I want to implement a web-based 3D sculpting modeling system as my final project.

It presents a big model as the scene in canvas and allows users' interaction to make sculpture on the model. The algorithm behind will do subdivision on mesh surface and perform the precise movement for points on mesh along their normal direction. Thus an effect of WYSIWYG will be shown to users, and it's a light-weighted solution for the small modification of 3D models.
